- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoBroPy
- 👀 I am interested in LP Python and also write parsers in my spare time
- 🌱 I'm currently studying to become a backender, but now I'm working on small programs like parsers and telegram-bots.
- 💞️ For now I want to try to register on freelance, and earn something for my work, but it's too vanilla a dream.
- 📫 If you suddenly want to contact me here are my social networks, Vk: kudasov0, Telegram: @Maxpyorg.
To all who see my description, I wish you kindness, positivity and health.
